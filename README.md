Mumblecore taxidermy is the new fad for 
music enthusiasts. What's better than 
enjoying a slow-carb, meal of forage salvia and 
watching your favorite four dollar toast rapper 
trying his damndest to speak through the 
formaldehyde. Grab a coloring book, put on a 
mukbang, thighten your man bun while enjoying 
an irony craft beer in this farm-to-table 
extravaganza.
